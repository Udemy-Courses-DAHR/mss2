Did you know that VS Code is not just for coding but also for documentation? Some developers mainly use it for that purpose. In this video, we'll show you how, along with some extensions that make the process even easier. Let's dive in.</p><p><strong>Markdown Overview</strong></p><p>Documenting in VS Code is straightforward using the markdown language, a lightweight markup language for text formatting. We'll use markdown for this demonstration. Right now, I have an open blank folder. Let’s create a document for reminders like a shopping list. I'll start by creating a file named 'reminder.md'. Visual Studio recognizes it as markdown, as you can see in the bottom right corner.</p><p><strong>Creating Lists</strong></p><p>It's almost like writing HTML, but much simpler. For a shopping list header, use a '#' followed by 'shopping list'. To preview, hit command K, release, and press V. For a subheading, use two pound signs. It's easy to create numbered lists too. For example, '1. Laptop', '2. Big mouse', '3. SSD hard drive'.</p><p><strong>Drag and Drop Images</strong></p><p>You can add images by dragging and dropping them into your folder, and the markdown will format it correctly. This shows how easy it is to create detailed, nicely formatted documentation.</p><p><strong>Adding Code</strong></p><p>For adding code, use three backticks and specify the language, like 'JS'. Close it with three more backticks. The formatting looks neat and clean.</p><p><strong>Adding Links</strong></p><p>To add links, put the link description in brackets and the destination in parentheses. For example, a link to 'readme.html'. You can easily navigate between multiple documentation pages using these links.</p><p><strong>Publishing Documentation</strong></p><p>To publish, use the source control, initialize the repository, commit, stage, and push to a repository like 'my Git Project C'.</p><p><strong>GitDoc for Documentation</strong></p><p>GitDoc is an extension that automatically commits, pushes, and pulls changes on save, like a Word document. It commits every 30 seconds, which you can adjust in the settings.</p><p><strong>VSCode.dev for Documentation</strong></p><p>You can also access your project using Visual Studio Code online at vscode.dev. Open a remote repository, make changes, stage them, and commit.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Documentation in VS Code is efficient and user-friendly, with a low learning curve. Various extensions, like GitDoc, enhance the experience. It's a great tool for creating well-organized and visually appealing documents.</p><hr><p>Now, applying this to the markdown template you provided:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Materia</th><th>Intro to Documentation in VS Code</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Capítulo</td><td>Markdown Overview, Creating Lists, Drag and Drop Images, Adding Code, Adding Links, Publishing Documentation, GitDoc for Documentation, VSCode.dev for Documentation</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>Cues</th><th>Notas</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Markdown, Extensions</td><td>While reading, note important aspects like markdown usage and extensions.</td></tr><tr><td>GitDoc, Publishing</td><td>Ask: How does GitDoc simplify the process?
